An activator protein bound to DNA at an upstream enhancer sequence can attract proteins to the promoter region that activate RNA polymerase (green) and thus transcription. The DNA can loop around on itself to cause this interaction between an activator protein and other proteins that mediate the activity of RNA polymerase. (Nature Education)
